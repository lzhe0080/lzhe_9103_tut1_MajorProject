# Major Project - Audio

## Iteration 1 

### Inspirations
In my sound design, I draw directly from **Max Neuhaus’s iconic *Times Square***, a sound installation that has long been an integral, yet subtle, part of the Times Square environment. Neuhaus’s piece, hidden beneath a pedestrian island grate, emits a low, resonant hum that blends with the city’s natural soundscape. Often mistaken for ambient subway noise, this sound is carefully crafted to evoke a “rich, harmonic sound texture resembling the after-ring of large bells,” creating an almost meditative auditory experience amid the bustling urban scene. Just as Mondrian’s composition reflects the grid-like energy and flow of Broadway, I try to bring the city’s pulse to life audibly, **merging visual and sonic interpretations of New York’s dynamic heartbeat**.

### Modifications
I added sound and used a button to control its playback. I also adjusted the **button’s style** to match the overall aesthetic of the scene. The **volume and panning** change with the movement of the **mouse**, and the **four buildings** in the scene move in sync with the panning as they shift left and right.

When you click play to start the music and slowly move the mouse to the left, the sound will gradually pan to the left, and you’ll see the image below.

***Note**: I used mouse interaction primarily to control sound variables, but it differs from the way other students interact with the blocks using user input by clicking.*

## Iteration 2

### Modifications
I added an effect where the size of the building blocks changes with the **root mean square (RMS) level**. As the mouse moves upward, the volume increases, and the buildings gradually emerge. This abstract effect enhances the linear quality, just like in the original artwork, while the lack of specific building shapes adds a sense of unease for the viewer.

When you click play to start the music and slowly move the mouse to the right, you’ll see the image below.
