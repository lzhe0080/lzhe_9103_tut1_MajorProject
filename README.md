# Iteration 1 

### Inspirations
In my sound design, I draw directly from **Max Neuhaus’s iconic *Times Square***, a sound installation that has long been an integral, yet subtle, part of the Times Square environment. Neuhaus’s piece, hidden beneath a pedestrian island grate, emits a low, resonant hum that blends with the city’s natural soundscape. Often mistaken for ambient subway noise, this sound is carefully crafted to evoke a “rich, harmonic sound texture resembling the after-ring of large bells,” creating an almost meditative auditory experience amid the bustling urban scene. Just as Mondrian’s composition reflects the grid-like energy and flow of Broadway, I try to bring the city’s pulse to life audibly, **merging visual and sonic interpretations of New York’s dynamic heartbeat**.

### Modifications
I added sound and used a button to control its playback. I also adjusted the **button’s style** to match the overall aesthetic of the scene. The **volume and panning** change with the movement of the **mouse**, and the **four buildings** in the scene move in sync with the panning as they shift left and right.

***Note**: I used mouse interaction primarily to control sound variables, but it differs from the way other students interact with the blocks using user input by clicking.*
